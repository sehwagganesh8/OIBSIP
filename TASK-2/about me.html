            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’m Sehwag Ganesh, a second-year computer science engineering student with a keen interest in startups,
                innovation, web development, and the latest in tech. I’m driven by a passion for creativity and
                problem-solving, and I love exploring how technology can create practical solutions and new
                opportunities. I’m constantly looking for ways to build my skills and work on projects that challenge me
                to think outside the box.</p>
            <p>As a hard worker with a focus on creative thinking, I believe in learning through hands-on experience and
                am excited to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios. I’m especially drawn to the fast-paced,
                ever-evolving world of startups, where innovation and growth come together. Whether I’m diving into
                front-end development or exploring new tech trends, I bring dedication and a strong work ethic to every
                task.</p>
